Simple projects while studying HTML, CSS and JS. Exercises taken from Khan Academy and udemy.com. All folder names begin with a number, to help me remember their chronological order. Of course I go back and improve some of them from time to time, as I learn new things and get better.

02_robot_friend: A robot that's moving its parts on mouse hover, simulating "dancing", if you have really vivid imagination. :p Simple placing and transforms using CSS.

05_shoplist: A simple shopping list, based on an exercise for a udemy lesson, teaching JS and how to manipulate the DOM. I kept the initial items provided by the exercise, just for reference. User can add a new item by typing it in the input box and clicking on "enter" (or pressing the Enter key), click on an item to mark it as "done" (click again to toggle) or delete it by clicking on "delete". I also added a button to clear the whole list, which was not part of the exercise. I'll probably keep improving it as it can be actually practical. Haven't bothered with how it looks, only with its functionality. Maybe I will some day.

06_gradient_gen: A gradient background generator, udemy.com exercise again. It starts with some default rgb values for both colours, displaying them for the user. The user can change either colours, left or right, or just press "random" to generate random colours on both sides. Made with CSS linear-gradient + JS.
